# Team Beverage End of Year Perfromance Project SQL --> Tableau

###### By: Steven Nguyen

## Introduction

#### In this project I will use MySQL to explore and analyze data and then visualize the data in Tableau to provide insights to the stakeholders.

## Objective
###### (*Please note that the names in the project are fictitious and are used only for the purpose of this project & the dataset is a mock dataset*)
##### I am a manager in sales covering NYC for a beverage company. Since it is the end of the year I am tasked with evaluating my teams performance this year and presenting it in a final Tableau story. The stakeholders need to know which employees hitting their metrics or not achieving their metrics. If not they need to know how will I improve their performance for the coming year. They need to also know which employees deserves a full merit increase and which employee is ready for a promotion. They also what KPI directly affect cases sold as it drives profit. They will need data driven insights from me. To deliver data driven insights to my stakeholder I will answer questions like:
	1. Which rep is performing the best or worst?
	2. Is there a correlation between # of account visits and cases sold?
	3. How do we improve the performance of the worst performing rep
	4. Is there any trends that is seen in the database?
	5. How do we makes sure we sell more cases for next year?
